## Total Time Spent on Project
**20 hours**

---

## 18.11.2025  
**Time spent:** ~4 hours  

### Work done
- Designed the **project poster**
- Researched and selected **all electronic components**
- Created a **BOM (Bill of Materials)**
- Built a **demo website** to explain the purpose of the device  
  - Used **Lovable** because I am still learning how to code
- Defined the **main idea and use case** of the device

I am preparing this project for a **national physics tournament** that will take place in **May**.  
The goal is to demonstrate a **portable, pocket-sized computing device**.  

Initially, the components were very expensive, but I discovered **Hack Club**, which made this project possible.

### Media

- Poster design

## 19.11.2025  
**Time spent:** ~7 hours  

### Work done
- Designed the **CAD enclosure**
- Started **PCB design**
- Tested early layouts and dimensions
- Ensured component fit inside the case

This stage focused on turning the idea into a **physical object**.

### Media
- CAD enclosure

## 05.12.2025  
**Time spent:** ~5 hours  

### Work done
- Adjusted the enclosure so the **screen fits perfectly**
- Changed the screen mounting method:
  - Instead of glue, I designed a **protective frame**
  - This made the device slightly bigger but much safer
- Began learning **PCB design basics**
- Decided to use a **breadboard** for now (safer and more flexible)

### Media
- First prototype

**Time spent:** ~4 hours  

### Additional update
- **Remade the BOM to be more budget-friendly**
  - Reduced the total cost by approximately **$20**
  - Replaced higher-cost suppliers with components sourced from **AliExpress**
  - Improved overall project feasibility while staying within strict budget constraints



## Summary
PicoPocket evolved from an idea into a **working prototype**, including:
- Electronics
- CAD enclosure
- Firmware planning
- Documentation
- Presentation materials

This project represents **technical learning** , especially within budget constraints.
