**PicoPocket** is a portable, pocket-sized computing device designed to function as a **digital wallet**.  
It combines a **battery-powered Raspberry Pi**, a **compact touchscreen display**, and **custom software** inside a **3D-printed enclosure** roughly the size of a bulky debit card.

I built this project to explore how everyday items like wallets could be redesigned using **embedded systems and modern electronics**. Instead of relying only on a smartphone, PicoPocket introduces the **wallet itself as a dedicated digital device**, focused on portability, simplicity, and experimentation.

### 💵 Estimated Total Cost

- **Parts only:** ≈ **$64.59 USD**  = 280.12 RON
---

### 📝 Notes

- All parts are sourced from **AliExpress** for cost efficiency.
- The project uses a **non-powered breadboard** (no boost converter, no breadboard PSU).
- Power is handled directly by the **TP4056 USB-C charging module**.
- A **boost converter was intentionally removed** to reduce complexity and risk.
- This BOM is **manually created** and not auto-generated by CAD/EDA tools.
