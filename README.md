**PicoPocket** is a portable, pocket-sized computing device designed to function as a **digital wallet**.  
The project combines a **battery-powered Raspberry Pi**, a **compact display**, and **custom software** inside a **3D-printed enclosure** roughly the size of a bulky debit card.

I made this project to explore how everyday items like wallets could be redesigned using **embedded systems and modern electronics**. Instead of relying only on a phone as a digital wallet, PicoPocket introduces the **wallet itself as a dedicated digital device**, focused on portability, simplicity, and experimentation.
